## Introduction

`RasterLayer`The layer mainly realizes the visualization of raster data. The main source of raster data is satellite remote sensing data, such as digital elevation map, vegetation distribution map, and night light map.

### Raster Data

Single band, mapped to color based on raster data value

### Raster RGB

Multi-band, different bands are mapped to R/G/B three-channel visual display

### Raster NDI

Multi-band, providing two bands for normalized index calculation`(b-a)/(b+a)`
