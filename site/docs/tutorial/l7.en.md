# L7 geospatial data visual analysis engine

✨ 2022.11.22 Version 2.11.0 officially released

⚠️ We will continue to follow up on user needs for version 1.x[Old version official website address](https://antv-2018.alipay.com/zh-cn/l7/1.x/index.html)

L7 is an open source large-scale geospatial data visual analysis development framework based on WebGL launched by Ant Financial’s AntV data visualization team. The L in L7 stands for Location, and 7 represents the seven continents of the world, implying the ability to provide visual analysis of global location data. L7 is based on graphic semiotics, converting abstract and complex spatial data into 2D and 3D symbols, and achieving rich visual expression through visual variables such as color, size, volume, and texture.
